Portfolio README
Project Description
Welcome to my portfolio website repository! This project showcases my skills and accomplishments through a meticulously designed website built with HTML and CSS. Below, I'll provide you with an overview of the different sections of the website and the technologies I've employed.

Website Sections
Header and Headline
At the top of the webpage, you'll find an elegant header and headline section. The header is thoughtfully crafted using Flexbox to ensure it's visually appealing.

Works Showcase
The "Works" section is where I present my notable projects. It features a grid layout that neatly displays four project cards. Each card is designed for optimal content presentation and alignment, achieved through the use of Flexbox.

About Me
In the "About Me" section, you'll discover information about my proficiency in programming languages, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I've also outlined my skills and mentioned the frameworks I'm experienced with. Flexbox has been employed here as well to maintain a clean and structured appearance.

Contact Form
To facilitate communication with visitors, I've integrated a user-friendly contact form. This form includes the following fields:

User Name: Visitors can provide their name (up to 30 characters).
Email: A space for visitors to share their email address.
Message: A textarea where visitors can compose messages, with a limit of 500 characters.
